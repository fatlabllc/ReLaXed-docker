  .content
    p You can write equations with MathJax:
    h4 $$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
    p Or code snippets with Highlight.js:
    pre.hljs
      code
        :highlight(lang='python')
          def relax(n_times):
              for i in range(100):
                  print ("Aaah. I'm so ReLaXed.")
    p Or even plots with Vegalite:
    .div(style='width:600px;margin:1em auto')
      include assets/plot.svg

each step in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    .header  What about progressive slides ?
    .content
      p.
        No problem ! This is done with Pug's native syntax, which enables
        even more complex logics !
      
      p For instance this slide has steps:
      
      p
        ul
          if step >= 2
            li Hey ! I am a paragraph appearing at step 2.
          if step === 3
            li Hi there ! I appears at step 3, and disappear at step 4.
          if step >= 4
            li Heya ! I appear at step 4
      
      if step >= 5
        p That's all for the moment folks, come back later to see if there is more !
