    Mainstream documents editor, such as MS Office or Google Docs, are often
    shuned by the technical community in favor of mark-up languages (Markdown,
    LaTeX, etc.), more adapted to technical writings and, more generally, to the
    quick generation of documents with consistent style. However, these
    languages have, in turn, limitations in their structure (title / sections /
    paragraphs) or accessibility in the case of LaTeX. In this paper we
    introduce a new PDF edition system ReLaXed, which takes advantage of the
    latest web technologies to enable fast, reliable PDF generation from
    languages such as Pug, HTML, or CSS, and relying on Google Chrome for
    rendering. ReLaXed enables to define complex layouts with CSS and Javascript
    while writing the content in a friendly, minimal syntax close to Markdown or
    LaTeX. It also features support for Markdown, LaTeX-style mathematical
    equations (via MathJax), plots generation (via Vegalite), diagram generation
    (via Mermaid). Many more features can be added simply by importing an
    existing Javascript of CSS framework.

    As of 2017, 73.5% of generated PDF documents originated from either MS
    Office or Google Docs (Jaeger *et al*, 2014). However, studies focusing on
    the scientific and technical community in particular have shown that this
    number falls to 25.5%, while the share of markup languages (Markdown, LaTeX)
    reaches to 55.2% in this group (Mikasa and Ackermann, 2011). This is
    generally explained by the fact that markup languages are more adapted to
    the quick writing of documents, with a focus on the content (the style of
    the document being generally delegated to separate configuration files).
    Markup languages are also more portable, i.e. can be written on any system
    and any text editor, and are more adapted to technical writing, supporting
    code snippets and mathematical equations such as this one:
    
    $$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$

    
    However, Markdown and LaTeX make it difficult to edit documents with a
    structure differing from the standard title-sections-paragraphs
    organization. In particular, LaTeX can be a fringing pain everytime you just
    want to move a damn image and you can't because you don't have a PhD in
    LaTeX and you keep getting cryptic error messages because certainly
    somewhere a bracket is missing.

    In this paper we introduce a new PDF edition system ReLaXed, which takes
    advantage of the latest web technologies to enable fast, reliable PDF
    generation from languages such as Pug, HTML, or CSS, and relying on Google
    Chrome for rendering.
    
    From now on it is only placeholder text. Current CSS frameworks will make
    sure your documents will look clean and modern. Javascript frameworks can
    plot schemas, highlight code, or render maths equations the same way LaTeX
    does. Millions of people (and growing) are now fluent in these technologies.
    Shorthand languages like Pug and SCSS are finally making it fun to write
    HTML and CSS. (Headless) web browsers can easily turn all these technologies
    into PDF, on any platform.

      **Figure 1:** A vectorial 3D plot generated by Matplotlib - how cool is
      that really. This was the result of a random search for Matplotlib 3D
      plots and frankly you can still do much better, but SVGs of 3D plots
      tend to be pretty big so at some point you gotta be like, ok that's
      cool, but all these bits going through the network are gonna break the
      internet.

    If we should claim at any time the right of criticism, we do it now, when the blunders and misfortunes which effected the failures of the last expeditions are deeply impressed on public minds, and nearly extinguish the little interest which is left for scientific work in the Arctic. We consider it in the spirit of progress of science, to prove the fallacy of a plan founded on theories like those of Mr. Melville, which cannot be accepted by scientific men, and must lead to disaster, or will at least be unsuccessful.
