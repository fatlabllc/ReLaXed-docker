# Creating a PDF Poster with ReLaXed

This directory contains a sample poster edited with ReLaXed.

> Master document: [``poster.pug``](https://github.com/RelaxedJS/ReLaXed-examples/blob/master/examples/poster/poster.pug). <br/>
Stylesheet: [``poster.scss``](https://github.com/RelaxedJS/ReLaXed-examples/blob/master/examples/poster/poster.scss).

Some highlights:

- Note how the master document simply defines each section and the general layout (using CSS Grid). Then each section is defined in its own file. This makes it super easy to swap the position of the different sections or give more space to some if necessary.
- Like in the report example, we are using Semantic UI for giving the poster a simple and modern look and feel (shadows, ribbons, and other widgets).
